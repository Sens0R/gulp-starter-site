            Skin care products are labelled for different skin types such as
            normal, oily, combination, dry or sensitive. But figuring out what
            your skin type is can be a little confusing sometimes, especially if
            there are a few different things happening with your skin at the
            same time. To figure out your skin type, wash your face with a
            facial cleanser meant for normal skin. Pat your skin dry and then do
            nothing else for the next 30 minutes. Now check your skin by looking
            in the mirror. How does your skin look and feel? Is it flaky or
            shiny? Does it feel tight or dry? Is it rough or smooth to the
            touch?
          </p>

          <p>
            If your skin is flaky and tight, you have dry skin. If your skin is
            shiny, you have oily skin. If your skin feels fine, you have normal
            skin. Should you find your skin is dry in some areas and oily in
            others, this means you have combination skin. If your skin flares up
            easily or becomes red or irritated when you use certain products,
            eat spicy foods or just catch a glimpse of sun, you have sensitive
            skin.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is, though, worth distinguishing whether you have sensitive or
            sensitised skin. Your skin may have become dry and sensitised due to
            your skin care routine and products, yet your skin is actually oily,
            and this is where is gets more difficult. Even though your skin type
            is actually oily, you will still need to treat the dryness and
            sensitisation before again using products designed for oily skin.

            This sounds very appealing and seems to make a lot of sense at
            first. But what is natural? This segment of skin care has seen major
            growth, and more and more brands have jumped on the bandwagon.
            Unfortunately, most are using this as a marketing claim rather than
            as an underlying business philosophy that guides all aspects of
            their operations.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is no established legal definition of exactly what natural is
            in Australia and so this is open to misrepresentation and
            manipulation. Irrespective of this, claims that a skin care product
            is natural need to be properly substantiated by brand owners,
            otherwise they can be in contravention of the Australian Consumer
            Law.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to the Macquarie Dictionary, natural is defined as
            ‘existing in or formed by nature’, ‘not artificial’ and ‘not
            synthetic’. However even natural raw materials are transformed
            through manufacturing processes before being used in cleansers,
            toners, serums and creams. Many brands claiming their skin care
            products are natural also use ingredients that are synthetic.
          </p>
          <p>
            To get around the ‘natural’ enigma, some brands claim their products
            are ‘chemical free’. But this is quite puzzling too as all skin care
            products contain ‘chemicals’, whether naturally occurring or not.
          </p>
          <p>
            The final matter to consider is the use of preservatives. To
            preserve the product and protect the user, preservatives need to be
            used to stabilise the formulation and prevent microorganisms forming
            and multiplying. To achieve this, many naturally oriented brands are
            using various essential oils and this presents several challenges.
            There have been cases where the products have not had adequate
            testing to ensure they are correctly preserved and safe for the
            declared shelf-life. Higher levels of essential oils are needed
            compared with synthetic preservatives and this raises the potential
            for irritation, whether immediately or further down the track, with
            the skin becoming sensitised. Further, some essential oils,
            especially at higher concentrations, can cause reactions when skin
            is exposed to the sun.
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to these reasons, it is not as simple as selecting your products
            based on claims that the product is ‘natural’. Always look at the
            ingredient list and ensure you stay clear of those ingredients that
            may not be good for your skin or you know you could react to, as
            they can come in both natural and synthetic forms.

            The way our skin ages is affected by our genes and the modulation of
            those genes, or what is known as epigenetics. While we cannot change
            our genes, emerging research is uncovering new ways in which we can
            influence them, such as stress management, quality sleep, physical
            activity, correct nutrition, not smoking, avoiding harmful chemicals
            and other environmental hazards, and sun protection. Just like your
            body, skin needs to be well nourished, so ensure you are eating the
            right foods and following a healthy lifestyle.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to influencing the way our skin ages from the inside
            out, we can influence the way it ages from the outside in.
            Everyone’s skin is going to age, however there are things you can do
            to prevent premature ageing. First and foremost, you need to use a
            sunscreen every day, even if it appears cloudy outside. The sun is
            responsible for a large amount of premature skin ageing, and the
            easiest and most effective way to protect our skin from the sun is
            by covering up and using sunscreen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Besides using sunscreen daily, if you want your skin to stay
            youthful for longer, you need to use products with antioxidants in
            them, such as Vitamin C, to protect your skin from inflammation and
            free radical damage. In addition, your skin needs to be well
            moisturised in order to stay healthy. You could also invest in a
            product that contains Retinol, since it can smooth fine lines and
            wrinkles while also helping to compensate for diminishing skin
            collagen.

            There is no single cream or combination of products that will keep
            our skin looking the way it did in your 20s. While there is nothing
            that truly turns back the hands of time, we can use products that
            make us appear younger. The closest we have in our current armoury
            of products that make a difference, both visually and measurably, is
            the well-researched prescription Tretinoin (Retinoic Acid), which is
            a synthetic Vitamin A. Tretinoin accelerates cell turnover to reveal
            younger skin and penetrates the dermis to stimulate the production
            of collagen, thereby diminishing fine lines and wrinkles. Due to its
            side effects, it is only available on prescription.
          </p>
          <p>
            However milder retinoids, such as Retinol, are readily available and
            can be found in many skin care products in varying strengths and
            using different delivery systems to maximise their absorption and
            minimise their irritation. When it comes to Retinol, the formulation
            is every bit as important as the amount of Retinol used.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other ingredients that help us in our quest to keep our skin looking
            as youthful as possible are sunscreens, AHAs, Vitamin C and
            Hyaluronic Acid. Check out the information we have provided on Hero
            Ingredients on our website for a more indepth look at this.

            Actives are ingredients in skin care products that address
            particular concerns. They can be found in everyday care products, as
            well as in prescription products targeting specific skin conditions.
            The best actives have a body of evidence behind them, such as
            Retinol, L-Ascorbic Acid, AHAs and BHA.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is also research behind a lot of other ingredients, including
            peptides, growth factors, antioxidants and botanicals, but usually
            not to the same standard. Some actives have a claimed effect or
            history of usage, but have little to no science to back up the
            claims made for them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cosmetic ingredient manufacturers make quite a few claims for their
            products and these ingredients are sold to brand owners for use in
            their formulations. Sometimes these manufacturers conduct their own
            research and testing on new or tweaked ingredients so as to be able
            to make scientific-sounding claims. However it is best to be a
            little questioning here and dig deeper to see whether you can find
            verification of their claims by way of peer-reviewed independent
            research and publication in leading journals. That said, even the
            best of actives may not work for everyone or not as well as we hoped
            for, so it is always important to be realistic.

            Traditionally, we have used products from the same brand and the
            same range of products. Skin care companies would have us believe
            that we need to use all the products in that particular range
            because they work best together or are not compatible with other
            products. However more and more people are becoming better educated
            and like to mix and match products from different ranges or even
            different brands. What is most important is that you find the right
            ingredients and formulations for your skin.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you prefer to buy products on their individual merits rather than
            their brand halo, make sure you know what is in your products and
            how to combine them. With more and more actives making it into skin
            care products, it is not always immediately obvious that combining
            certain products can be detrimental to your skin. When brands are
            formulating a range, they take into account that you will be likely
            using a number of the products and will be layering them. Obviously,
            this is not the case when you are combining multiple skin care
            products from different brands. For example AHAs, L-Ascorbic Acid
            and Retinol can irritate your skin if overused or incorrectly
            combined, so make sure you know what you are using.

            While topical products have come a long way, and there are so many
            more skin issues that can be treated today without the use of more
            invasive procedures, everything has its limitations. Sometimes it
            may be necessary to consider in-clinic treatments, such as
            microneedling, peels or laser.

            If your skin has not responded to topical treatments or you have not
            been able to achieve the degree of improvement you are looking for
            to treat your acne, capillaries, pigmentation, scarring or uneven
            texture, find a reputable clinic and talk to them about your
            options. Make sure you feel comfortable about the treatment or
            treatments being proposed, and ensure you ask the right questions,
            including whether your skin is suitable for the treatment, what
            results you can expect and what side effects are possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            While some treatments are relatively inexpensive and painless,
            others can cost thousands, be painful and have the potential for
            serious side effects, such as ablative lasers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Only proceed if you feel confident in the clinician and treatment.
            It really does pay to do your homework and be cautious, especially

            We know that micellar water makes things quick and easy for you, but
            the effort you put in now determines what type of skin you will have

            The occasional use of micellar water is no biggie, however regular
            use of it will do your skin no good. You know that chemicals,
            pollutants, dirt, grime, creams and makeup make it onto your skin
            and into your pores each day. For skin health, it is important to
            remove these products and the build-up of dead skin cells properly.
            Wipes and micellar water move all this icky and gunky stuff around
            your face without truly removing it. A thorough cleanse with rinsing
            will prepare your skin so that it better absorbs your treatment

            micellar water on your eyes and the risk of bacterial overgrowth and
            Meibomiam Gland Dysfunction (MGD), a serious eye condition that
            damages the eyelids’ oil glands and makes your eyes feel gritty, dry
            and irritated.
          </p>
          <p>
            A commonly used preservative in micellar water is Disodium EDTA,
            which is very irritating to the surface of the eye.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, we are passing on the use of micellar water as a regular
            cleanser. But, if after all that you still want to use it, go ahead
            but make sure you rinse it all off or, better still, use a rinse-off
            version.

            Double cleansing is great if you wear mineral sunscreen or heavy
            makeup, and should be limited to once a day. Oil cleansers work
            wonders to remove those difficult-to-remove creams without drying
            out the skin. Given that oil cleansers can leave some oil residue,
            which could block pores, it is best to follow up with a gentle
            second cleanser. In this way, you can thoroughly clean your pores
            and remove all sunscreen and makeup without irritating or damaging
            the skin barrier. Oil cleansers can also be helpful to anyone with a
            dry or very sensitive skin when applied before heading into the
            shower, as they protect the skin and stop it from drying out,
            especially if you are using shampoo.
          </p>
          <p>
            Check the composition of your oil cleanser to ensure it is a true
            oil cleanser with gentle, nourishing light oils, and not a
            surfactant cleanser with a little oil thrown in simply to enable it
            to be called an oil cleanser. If you wear heavy eye makeup or
            waterproof mascara, use lash extensions or have sensitive eyes, it
            is best to avoid using an oil cleanser on your eyes and eyelashes.
            Try applying a gentle no-oil and no-alcohol eye cleanser first,
            before proceeding with using the oil cleanser on the rest of your
            face.

            Regular skin exfoliation is the key to smooth, bright, and clear
            skin, but it can get downright confusing to know how often to
            exfoliate. For most people, exfoliating the face and body two times
            a week is adequate, although some may do it a little more frequently
            and others less. It really does depend.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, someone with oily, acne-prone skin that needs to be
            decongested will be different to someone with sensitive skin that is
            easily irritated. It also depends on the type of exfoliant being
            used and the strength of it. An enzymatic cleanser is going to be
            milder than an AHA toner and an AHA toner is going to be milder than
            an exfoliating peel. Keep in mind that the stronger your chosen
            exfoliation product, the less often you should use it. Damaging your
            skin barrier ages your skin rather than improves it.
          </p>
          <p>
            The skin on our bodies is usually less sensitive than the skin on
            our faces so it can be exfoliated several times a week without
            issues. This may be something you want to do regularly in summer
            when you expose more skin and maybe even apply artificial tanning
            products. It also may be quite helpful for anyone who suffers from
            dry, flaky skin in winter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Exfoliation provides our skin with a helping hand as we get older.
            The outer layer of skin is a condensed layer of spent skin cells and
            it thickens as we age, so exfoliating can reveal fresher skin.
          </p>
          <p>
            By exfoliating, you are encouraging the turnover of skin and
            preparing it to better absorb treatments and moisturisers. Remember,
            though, that even a good thing can be overdone. If you do it too
            often, or too aggressively, your skin can become irritated or
            sensitised, and this can be counter-productive.

            This comes up a lot and is really a matter of personal preference.
            If you use the right products to cleanse, you do not necessarily
            need a toner. If you prefer to use one, though, we suggest using a
            treatment toner or essence, otherwise it could just be an
            unnecessary step in your beauty routine. Save the time, effort and

            The skin around your eyes is thinner, more sensitive and has its own
            distinct set of needs. Eye creams and eye gels are specifically
            formulated to suit this delicate area of your face, and they can
            have a different consistency to other skin products.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some people advocate just using your regular serum or face
            moisturiser, however this may not be the best approach to tackle
            your specific eye area concerns or even to correctly nourish and
            protect the skin around your eyes. Eye treatments often seek to
            address a number of issues that are quite specific to the eye area,
            while still being gentle.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eye treatments are not miracle products, and some of the claims made
            for them may be exaggerated. However they can do more for the eye
            area and cause less irritation than other products that have been
            developed for the rest of your face. For example, a standard AHA,
            L-Ascorbic Acid or Retinol product may be too irritating to use
            around your eyes because the concentration of actives is too high. A
            rich moisturiser may cause milia to form under the surface of the
            skin around the eyes. A product with fragrance or essential oils may
            cause eye irritation and watering.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also consider the importance of protecting the skin around the eyes
            from UV damage. Regular sunscreens are quite problematic in this
            area for most people, so if you can find an eye cream with
            protection that does not cause you any issues, you are on a winner.
            The skin around our eyes is prone to sun damage and premature
            ageing, just like the rest of our skin.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have oily skin or are prone to milia, you can select an eye
            gel. If your skin is particularly dry and you need extra
            nourishment, a cream will work better. And then, of course, there
            are eye treatments that are designed for use during the day and work
            well under eye makeup and those that are better suited to use in the
            evening.
          </p>
          <p>
            While eye formulas may add another step to your beauty routine, we
            still think they play an important role in keeping the skin around
            your eyes at its best and help avoid potential problems that can
            arise from applying other, non-suitable products.

            Skin needs to maintain a healthy balance between water and oil, with
            a ratio of 70% to 30% considered to be ideal. Stripping the skin of
            all its natural oils will not prevent you from getting blemishes and
            could even make them worse, as the skin’s oils, known as lipids,
            also play a protective and antibacterial role. Overzealous cleaning,
            heavy exfoliation, use of drying products and lack of proper
            moisturisation can lead to an impaired skin barrier, making it more
            susceptible to irritation, moisture loss and infection.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dry skin appears older and more wrinkled, and over time can become
            prematurely aged. Not what most of us are trying to achieve!
          </p>
          <p>
            Most people can add oils to their beauty routine, even those with
            oily skin, whether as a first cleanser or as a final step in their
            skin care routine. However anyone wanting to incorporate a skin oil
            should be mindful of the characteristics of different types of oils,
            as some can be heavy, thick and clog pores.
          </p>
          <p>
            Oily and acne-prone skin types have overactive oil glands, and for
            most people it makes intuitive sense not to add any more oil to
            their skin. However there is a little more to it. Oils that are
            closest to the skin’s own lipids and have a small molecular size are
            the ones that are going to absorb more easily and not feel greasy.
            Marula, Jojoba and Squalene are three types of oils that are lighter
            and more easily absorbed. They generally can be used by those with
            dry, normal, combination and even oily skin types. Argan, Buckthorn,
            Kukui and Rosehip are also low comedogenic oils and may also work
            for those with oilier skin.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember to go easy with the amount of oil you use on your skin. Two
            to three drops applied to the face after your moisturiser has
            absorbed should be more than enough. This gives your skin additional
            protection and helps seal in moisture, which may be a good option
            for you at night.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, as every skin is unique, it is always important to test a
            product first, as what works for one person does not work for
            another, even when they have the same skin type. Naturally, there
            are some people who do not enjoy using oils on their skin, and that
            is OK too. Load up instead on other skin moisturising factors.

            Skin can become dry and flaky for a number of different reasons:
            skin type, age, hormones, aggressive treatments, types of products
            used, harsh weather, heating and air-conditioning, diet, medication
            … It is important to work out what the cause is, where possible, and
            tackle this aspect while also topically treating your skin to some
            extra care and attention.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most people are too aggressive with their skin and overdo their
            cleansing and exfoliation, while underdoing their nourishing and
            protection. Always use a gentle cleanser, rather than an aggressive
            one that strips your skin, and lightly pat your skin dry after
            washing. Try using a clean microfibre or polyester face cloth to
            rinse off cleanser rather than splashing your face with water as
            this can help too. Remember to only use tepid water rather than hot
            water. If you cleanse under the shower, consider using a more
            nourishing, protective-type face cleanser, as your shampoo and hot
            water may be contributing to the problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            Step up your routine. Try gently exfoliating a few times a week,
            incorporating some hydrating masks, switching to a richer
            moisturiser and adding a skin oil as your final layer in the evening
            to prevent moisture loss.
